# VacationVault
<h3>Organize and Track all of your Vacations</h3>

The goal of the VacationVault app is to assist travelers in managing their vacations and 
excursions. It is a multi-screen mobile application that permits users to input, modify, and remove 
data regarding their vacations and excursions. The app should display a comprehensive list and 
detailed view of each vacation and excursion, and send notifications for all relevant dates. The 
application leverages the Room Framework to function as an abstraction layer over the local SQLite 
database.
